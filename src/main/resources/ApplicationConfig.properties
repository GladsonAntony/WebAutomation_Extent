#Launch SafariBrowser:
	#Launching Safari browser in Selenium 3 is bit different from chrome and firefox as Safari is giving provision to launch the browser in 
	#different way. For, this we do not need to download any files. Instead, need to do some configuration in the safari browser. 
	#Below are the steps to perform before writing the selenium code:

	#We need to enable the Develop menu in the Safari browser. For this need to go to Safari > Preferences. 
	#Then go to Advanced tab then check the "Show Develop menu in menu bar" checkbox.
	#Tick the "Allow Remote Automation" in Develop menu.
